# How to Play

- Spend 5 points among your traits (min 0 max 3): Kind, Fierce, Curious, Precise, Insightful;
- Write 5 burdens. Something that you: wield, wear, chase, fear, keep secret. Try to forget which is which.
- Each burden starts with 3 points of weight.

## Dice

1. Choose a trait for your actions and roll as many d6 as that trait's score and keep the highest. If a score is 0, then roll 2d6 and keep the lowest.
2. You can choose a burden to lean on and add as many dice as its weight, from 1 to 3, then reduce its weight by 1.
3. You get a hit if you roll a 6, a twist if you roll 4 or 5, and a miss if you roll 3 or less.

## Roll to:

- Try something that can fail or go wrong;
- Directly engage a Challenge;
- Persuade or influence someone;
- Get information about people and things;
- Avoid badness or reduce a high cost.

On a hit you usually get what you want, or most of it. On a twist, you gotta pay a price, make a bargain or not get what you want completely or the way you want it. On a miss, brace yourself.

## Special

Erase a burden to replenish the weight on other burdens by up to 3 points. 

If you lose all weight on all burdens, erase a burden and you are out of action.

If you erase all burdens, you become unburdened and you must choose how you overcome the challenge you're facing. Write a new burden related to the challenge you just faced and another related to how you overcame it. You die if you become unburdened again.

# Growth

- Roll a miss;

# Challenges

Challenges may be a barrier to cross, a difficult negotiation or a battle of some sort.

When the characters find a challenge, write an obstacle, one or two words long.

Give that obstacle one to three points of resilience.
