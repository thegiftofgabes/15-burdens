# The Weight

This is a lightweight game about the heavy things we come to rely on.

You'll need at least two people and some 6-sided dice.

One of the players will play as the GM, the others will play as the Player Characters.

Play to find out how the things that you rely on weigh down on you. Will you let go or will you break under them?

# Setting

As a group, choose 2 to 3 words to define a setting:

Pre-colonial, Urban, Pastoral, Weird, Ancient, Fantasy, Sci-fi, Space, Drama, Wild, Dungeon, Deep.

# How to Play

Come up with a name and pronouns, then choose 2 to 3 words to define your character:

Scavengers, Bounty Hunters, Exiles, Wanderers, Scholars, Soldiers, Magic-Users, Rebels, Mystical, Homebound.

- Spend 5 points among your Trait scores (min 0 max 3): Kindness, Grit, Attention, Precision, Insight;
- Write 5 Burdens to rely on. Something that you: **wield, wear, seek, fear, hide**. Try to forget which is which. All of them start with 3 Hold;
- Write in a piece of Miscellanea and start with Barter 3.

## Action Rolls

1. Describe what you're trying to do and how, as dramatically or low-key as necessary;
2. Choose what Trait fits your action best;
3. Choose a Burden to rely on if you think it will help or make sense;
4. Roll as many d6 as your Trait score, plus how many Hold your Burden still has, if you rely on any. 
    
    If the total number of dice is still less than 1, roll 2d6 and keep the lowest result.
    
5. You get a strong hit if you roll a 6, a weak hit if you roll 4 or 5, and a twist if you roll 3 or less.

## Roll to:

- Try something that can fail or go wrong;
- Directly engage a Challenge;
- Persuade or influence someone;
- Get information about people, places or things;
- Avoid badness or undesired outcomes.

On a strong hit you usually get what you want, or most of it.

On a weak hit, you gotta pay a price, make a bargain, or not get what you want the way you want it.

On a twist, brace yourself. Maybe you don't get what you want, or you still do, but it makes things worse, somehow.

## Burdens

When you Give Up a Burden, erase it. It's gone, maybe forever. Describe what happens. 

Give Up a Burden to turn a bad outcome into a good outcome, then describe what happened.

Give Up a Burden to regain 3 Hold to distribute among the remaining Burdens.

If you lose all Hold on all Burdens, you become Overwhelmed, and you can't go on. Figure out what it means.

If you Give Up all Burdens, you become Unburdened, and the brief relief it gives you allows you to push yourself beyond your limits.

Choose how you overcome the challenge you're facing. Write a new burden related to the challenge you just faced and another related to how you overcame it, then you become Overwhelmed.

## Miscellanea and Barter

When you find a relevant item, such as a magic scroll or an access key, write it in as Miscellanea. Erase it when you lose it or spend it.

When you wish to acquire Miscellanea, roll Barter spent. On a strong hit, you get it, or it is going to come to you. On a weak hit, you learn where it is or how to get it. On a miss, you can't get it now.

Spend 1 Barter to produce a mundane item to allow you to navigate a situation or traverse a location, such as a rope, a climbing harness or a set of picklocks. Spend 1 hold to keep it as Miscellanea.

When you undertake a journey, spend 1 Barter for every day of travel, or for as long as it is sensible.

# Respite

When you find a place of fleeting calm and you do nothing but rest, regain 1 Hold. If someone takes care of you, you regain 1 extra Hold.

When you find a place to rest for a while and take care of yourself, regain 3 Hold per day of absolute rest.

When you wish to write a new Burden or regain one lost, start a clock. The GM will determine how long it will take to complete it and what kind of tasks you must perform.

# Growth

You get 1 XP when you:

- Roll a miss;
- Give Up a burden;

Spend 7 XP to raise a trait by 1, or to gain or regain a Burden.

# The Guide and Mediator

Your role is to describe the world, its contents, and the outcomes of actions. Remember to:

- Play to find out what happens;
- Address the characters, not the players;
- Say what honesty demands;
- Make their lives interesting;
- Draw maps, but leave blanks;
- Ask questions and build on the answers.

## GM Moves

When a player rolls a miss, or when you need to know what happens next, use one of these GM moves:

### Warn them

- Show signs of trouble elsewhere;
- Start a clock or tick a clock.

### Strike at Them

- Hurt them or their friends;
- Separate them;
- Steal, damage, or break something or someone.

### Twist The Outcome

- Offer a hard bargain;
- Give what they think they want;
- Reveal an opportunity, with or without a cost.

### Escalate

- Show the downside of their stuff;
- Introduce new problems;
- Make the situation worse.

## Clocks

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/c8496335-d06a-4218-802d-8e851936efd0/Untitled.png)

Clocks are a way of keeping track of events and action that happens in the background. Advancing a clock signifies that there is something that will happen sooner rather than later.

Divide a circle into sections as needed. Start it full, empty or halfway. Tick it up or down as events occur, and trigger new events when it fills or empties. 

Track things like resources, situations, travel, threats, hunger, XP, etc.

## Threats

Different kinds of threats have extra, more specific GM moves to inspire you. Combine threats as you see fit.

### Cursed Places

- Shift, move, rearrange;
- Disgorge something;
- Lure someone in;
- Leave a mark on someone.

### Overlords

- Attack suddenly, directly, forcefully;
- Seize something or someone for leverage or information;
- Negotiate, promise, demand;
- Claim territory.

### Swarms

- Grow in size;
- Raise a champion;
- Overwhelm.

### Afflictions

- Make the smallest thing a struggle;
- Spread to someone new;
- Present a false perception.

### Terrors

- Appear from nowhere;
- Inflict horror upon a victim.
